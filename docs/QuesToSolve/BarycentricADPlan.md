1. clear the theory of barycentric algorithm (Done)
2. clear AD, especially AD fo SVD (Done)
3. apply AD for barycentric algorithm for continuous spectral density
4. apply AD for barycentric algorithm for discrete spectral density and strengthen the accuracy (maybe by optimize)
5. clear the teorey of denoise and apply AD for it
