It's a kind of Monte Carlo with mutable fine mesh. It's extremely slow (different from what is claimed in the paper).

And it's expansion form  only considers poles on the real axis. So how does it fit smooth spectrum?

By the way, I have  tested `spx` with a smaller scale parameters of [SPXparameters](https://huangli712.github.io/projects/acflow/man/param.html#stochpx_block) and the program just blew up.
